[access_scopes]
# Minimal scopes for Hydrogen storefront
# Note: Storefront API uses public access tokens and doesn't require these scopes
# These are only needed if you plan to use Admin API for backend operations
# For a basic storefront, you can use: "read_products" or remove this section entirely
scopes = "read_products"

[auth]
# OAuth redirect URLs for app installation
# Replace with your actual domain after deployment
redirect_urls = [
  "https://your-store.myshopify.com/auth/callback",
  "https://your-store.myshopify.com/auth/shopify/callback",
  "https://your-store.myshopify.com/api/auth/callback"

# Check for updates: https://shopify.dev/docs/api/release-notes

# Development Notes:
# ==================
# 1. For local development, your Storefront API credentials go in .env file
# 2. This file is primarily for Shopify CLI and admin app integration
# 3. For production, ensure all placeholder values are replaced
# 4. Use minimal scopes following principle of least privilege

[access_scopes]

# Development Notes:
# ==================
# 1. For local development, your Storefront API credentials go in .env file
# 2. This file is primarily for Shopify CLI and admin app integration
# 3. For production, ensure all placeholder values are replaced
# 4. Use minimal scopes following principle of least privilege
